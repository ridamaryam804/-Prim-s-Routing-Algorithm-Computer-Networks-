Contains the full source code and compiled `.jar` file:
CoreGraphHandler.java` – Handles graph data and logic.
Edge.java` – Defines the edge structure and weight.
PrimsRoutingSimulator.java` – Main class with GUI and routing simulation.
CN_CEP_2.jar` – Compiled runnable Java application.

# Files:
GitHubRepoLink.txt – Contains the GitHub repository URL:
  > [https://github.com/mairu123/Computer_Networks](https://github.com/mairu123/Computer_Networks)
CEP_Report.pdf` – Project report describing problem statement, methodology, and results.
Project_Video.mp4` – Demonstration video of the running project, explaining edge cases and simulation.


# How to Run the Project
 Using the `.jar` File
1. Make sure Java 17+ is installed.
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the `code` folder.
4. Run the application with:
